This is a library written in C for fitting two-dimensional Gaussian functions. To test this library, a Python script interfaces with it using ctypes. The Python script generates a random set of 10000 points. We calculate the value of a Gaussian function at these points and test if the library can retrieve the parameters which were used to generate the dataset. For further details, please consult the readme.pdf file

To begin, run the runMe.py file
